# GET Data Science Program, January 2022

These are the Jupyter Notebooks for my lectures in the GET
program, initially delivered in January 2022.

Most of the content is in Jupyter notebooks: use the launcher below to get started.

## First Lecture -- Data Structures in Python

There are a few notebooks of interest:
 - [`Fib.ipynb`](Fib.ipynb) is a toy Fibonacci calculator.
 - [`Lists.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) is about lists.
 - [`Dictionaries.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) is about dictionaries and sets.

During class we interacted with those notebooks, so these versions
have the messages saved:
 - [`Lists-class.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) 
 - [`Dictionaries-class.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) 
 - [`Objects-class.ipynb`](Data.ipynb)  Created from scratch during
class; this one demonstrates objects using Python's built-in classes,
objects using dictionaries, and function/variable scoping.

Here are the slides for the first lecture:

## Second Lecture -- Introduction to Seaborn

 - [`Iris.ipynb`](Iris.ipynb) uses the Iris built-in dataset.
 - [`Iris-class.ipynb`](Iris-class.ipynb) is the in-class version.
 - [`Happy.ipynb`](Happy.ipynb) Uses the World happiness dataset from Kaggle.  Unfortunately my attempt to combine the different years did not work so well.

## Third Lecture -- Analyzing data

 - [`ascombe.ipynb`](ascombe.ipynb) - Four data sets with the same linear regression line, only one of which is appropriate.
 - [`covid.ipynb`](covid.ipynb) - Statistics on the Omicron variant.
 - [`insurance.ipynb`](insurance.ipynb) - Smokers vs non-smokers
 - [`company_ipo.ipynb`](company_ipo.ipynb) - A data set we had to clean (converting dollar amounts to floating points).

## Resources for data projects

You need data if you're going to do a data project!  Here are some ideas.

- [Seaborn](https://python.plainenglish.io/9-datasets-for-data-science-ml-beginners-cfb57df53fda) -- Well, these aren't good for your project, but they are excellent for trying out different plot styles and learning Seaborn better.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) --- Tons of data sets uploaded by users.  I would recommend checking here first!
- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets) --- They sell online data visualization software.  They also provide some free sets you can download.
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) --- A famous prediction site, one of the few to predict that Trump would beat Clinton.  They have tons of data to download!

- [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)  --- Not data, but a book on producing charts; both what to do an things to avoid.

## Other documentaion

- [Data Frames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) --- The data frame structure comes from Pandas.  There is a LOT you can do with it.
  Here is the official documentation.
- [Data Frame Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_dataframe.htm) --- A gentler walkthrough of data frames.
