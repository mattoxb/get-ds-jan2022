# GET Data Science Program, January 2022

These are the Jupyter Notebooks for my lectures in the GET
program, initially delivered in January 2022.

There are a few notebooks of interest:
 - [`Fib.ipynb`](Fib.ipynb) is a toy Fibonacci calculator.
 - [`Data.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) contains the examples from the
first lecture on Python's data structures.
 - [`Vis.ipynb`](Vis.ipynb) contains the examples from the
second lecture on visualizations using Seaborn.

Use the launcher below to get started.
