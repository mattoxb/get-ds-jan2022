# GET Data Science Program, January 2022

These are the Jupyter Notebooks for my lectures in the GET
program, initially delivered in January 2022.

There are a few notebooks of interest:
 - [`Fib.ipynb`](Fib.ipynb) is a toy Fibonacci calculator.
 - [`Lists.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) is about lists.
 - [`Dictionaries.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) is about dictionaries and sets.

During class we interacted with those notebooks, so these versions
have the messages saved:
 - [`Lists-class.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) 
 - [`Dictionaries-class.ipynb`](Data.ipynb) 
 - [`Objects-class.ipynb`](Data.ipynb)  Created from scratch during
class; this one demonstrates objects using Python's built-in classes,
objects using dictionaries, and function/variable scoping.

Here are the slides for the first lecture:
